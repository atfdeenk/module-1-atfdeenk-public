Im building a responsive website which the main topic is revolving around articles about BMW.

The website also has a grid layout displaying several image and a **_Contact Us_** form to send a message by filling out their **name, email, choosing a country where they came from and writing a message they want to deliver**. Then click the button for sending their message.
